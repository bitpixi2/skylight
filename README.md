# Brenton's Flight Deck

A live flight display for Victoria, adaptable between a regular TV or touchscreen
and a fullscreen ceiling installation using an inexpensive vertical projector at
about the $100 mark. It combines real aircraft positions around the viewing area
and Melbourne Airport with a current sky map, local weather, and clocks.

This is a Melbourne-focused fork of [cpaczek/skylight](https://github.com/cpaczek/skylight).

## The display

Brenton's Flight Deck alternates every 45 seconds between two wide live views:

- **Runway view** — a home-centred 70 km radar/map with live aircraft positions,
  compass rings, trails, and Melbourne Airport (MEL/YMML) runway context in its
  real geographic direction.
- **Overhead view** — an altitude-aware sky dome calculated from an approximate
  viewpoint in Victoria, with aircraft, stars, planets, the sun, moon, satellites,
  compass directions, and elevation rings in their current positions.
- **Follow view** — select a live aircraft on the main field or in the lower strip
  to centre an 18 km moving view on that aircraft until **Stop following** is pressed.

The large **Runway / Overhead / Follow** touch control switches views immediately,
the cursor remains visible in Kiosk 1, and the **Expand** button takes the display
fullscreen. The screen is divided into:

- a full-width header with Melbourne local time and live status;
- a large live radar or sky view across the left side;
- a current-weather card above the aircraft card on the right, showing details only
  when supplied by the live feeds; and
- a lower strip with the next five aircraft by distance. Each tile is a button
  that centres and follows that aircraft while opening its details in the right rail.

Airline SVGs are matched from the verified three-letter operator prefix in the
aircraft callsign. If a callsign has no confident match, the display leaves the
logo out rather than guessing.

When no aircraft is close, the side card switches to a quiet-sky state with the
next calculated ISS pass while the looking-up view continues to show current
celestial positions.

Aircraft positions refresh about every three seconds, the clocks tick every second,
and current weather is refreshed every five minutes from 15-minute model conditions.

## TV or ceiling use

Open the deployed site in the TV's browser with `/?kiosk=1` appended to the URL.
Tap **Expand** to request fullscreen mode and a screen wake lock. The same 16:9
layout is designed to work on a regular TV, an Echo Show 15 or framed touchscreen,
or a ceiling-filling image from a roughly $100 vertical projector.

The public display uses only an approximate viewpoint in Victoria. It does not
show or store a household name, street address, or house-level coordinate.

### Minimal ceiling projector

Open `/?kiosk=2` for the separate projector presentation. It keeps only the
full-screen overhead aircraft field, longer-lived trails, stars,
constellation lines, the Moon, planets and satellites; the nearest aircraft's
callsign, type, altitude, and speed appear for 12 seconds, then the aircraft
label disappears for 12 seconds. There are no dashboard panels or visible
cursor.

Kiosk 2 requests a screen wake lock immediately and enters fullscreen on its
first pointer gesture. A deployment built with `VITE_DEFAULT_KIOSK=2` opens this
projector presentation by default, which is how the separate projector website
is published.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 20 or newer.

```bash
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm build
DATA_SOURCE=api corepack pnpm start
```

Then open:

- Display: `http://localhost:3000/?kiosk=1`
- Minimal projector: `http://localhost:3000/?kiosk=2`
- Fixed runway view: `http://localhost:3000/?view=runway`
- Fixed overhead view: `http://localhost:3000/?view=overhead`

For development with hot reload:

```bash
DATA_SOURCE=api corepack pnpm dev
```

## Deploy

The hosted display is a Vite build with small Vercel functions for live aircraft,
weather, and satellite data.

```bash
vercel deploy -y
```

No API keys are required for the public feeds currently used by the display.

## Checks

```bash
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm build
```
