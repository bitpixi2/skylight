# Brenton's Flight Deck

A live flight display for Victoria, adaptable between a regular TV or touchscreen
and a fullscreen ceiling installation using an inexpensive vertical projector at
around the A$100–A$150 mark. It combines real aircraft positions around the
viewing area and Melbourne Airport with a current sky map, local weather, and clocks.

This is a Melbourne-focused fork of [cpaczek/skylight](https://github.com/cpaczek/skylight).

## Display options

### Option 1 — TV dashboard (Free)

![Brenton's Flight Deck running as the full interactive TV dashboard](docs/brentons-flight-deck-tv.png)

Use the full 16:9 dashboard on a regular TV, Echo Show 15, or framed touchscreen
at no extra hardware or subscription cost when using a screen and internet
connection you already have. Open it in either of these ways:

- **TV browser:** open the [public Kiosk 1 dashboard](https://skylight-melbourne.vercel.app/?kiosk=1)
  directly in the TV's built-in browser.
- **Screen mirroring:** open the same Kiosk 1 link on a phone, tablet, or computer,
  then mirror or cast that screen to the TV with AirPlay, Google Cast, Miracast,
  or a wired HDMI connection where supported.

Features include a live 70 km runway radar, overhead sky, tap-to-follow aircraft,
current weather, airline logos and the next five flights. Aircraft update about
every three seconds, with Runway and Overhead views alternating every 45 seconds.

Tap **Expand** after opening the dashboard to request fullscreen mode and a screen
wake lock. Kiosk 1 keeps the cursor visible and provides the interactive **Runway**,
**Overhead**, and **Follow** controls.

The airline logo SVGs shown in the dashboard are provided by

### Option 2 — Overhead Projector (About A$150)

![Brenton's Overhead running as the minimal ceiling projector view](docs/brentons-overhead-projector.png)

Open the [public Kiosk 2 projector](https://brentons-overhead.vercel.app) for the
separate ceiling presentation. It shows live aircraft with longer trails, stars,
constellations, the Moon, planets, satellites and basic details for the nearest
flight. There are no dashboard panels or visible cursor. It requests a screen
wake lock immediately and enters fullscreen on its first tap.

#### Example vertical projector

[![Kimwood vertical projector showing ceiling-scale projection sizes](docs/kimwood-projector-example.png)](https://www.amazon.com.au/Kimwood-Projector-Bluetooth-Ultra-Projectors/dp/B0G1S78RNM)

[View the Kimwood projector on Amazon Australia](https://www.amazon.com.au/Kimwood-Projector-Bluetooth-Ultra-Projectors/dp/B0G1S78RNM).
The linked model is currently available from A$145.99. It is an example of the
inexpensive rotating-projector style suited to the ceiling setup; availability
and pricing can change.

### Option 3 — Overhead Projector Premium

For a brighter, more permanent ceiling installation, use a Raspberry Pi as the
dedicated player and a Full HD standard-throw projector. The Pi boots directly
into Kiosk 2, so the projector only needs to provide a reliable HDMI image.
